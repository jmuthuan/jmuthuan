# About me
I am an Electronic Engineer and a Senior Programming Technician specializing in software development and Android mobile applications. Throughout my career, I have focused on transforming complex challenges into effective technological solutions. With expertise in languages such as **Java**, **Kotlin**, **JavaScript**, and development tools like **Android Studio** and web development, I am passionate about creating software that solves real-world problems, optimizing processes, and enhancing user experiences.

My approach always revolves around understanding clients' needs and problems and turning them into functional solutions. I have a strong ability to research and quickly adapt to new technologies, tools, libraries, and frameworks. I enjoy taking on challenges that require critical and "out-of-the-box" thinking, delivering innovative and tailored solutions for each project.

My goal is to continue growing in the software development field, applying my problem-solving skills and passion for technology to every project, whether in mobile development, web solutions, or more complex systems. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, practicing sports, and continuously exploring new technologies to further advance my professional growth.
